# stripe_accounts (Resource)





<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `account_token` (String) An [account token](https://stripe.com/docs/api#create_account_token), used to securely provide details to the account.
- `bank_account` (String) Either a token, like the ones returned by [Stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/js), or a dictionary containing a user's bank account details.
- `business_profile` (Map of String) Business information about the account.
- `business_type` (String) The business type.
- `capabilities` (Map of String) Each key of the dictionary represents a capability, and each capability maps to its settings (e.g. whether it has been requested or not). Each capability will be inactive until you have provided its specific requirements and Stripe has verified them. An account may have some of its requested capabilities be active and some be inactive.
- `company` (Map of String) Information about the company or business. This field is available for any `business_type`.
- `country` (String) The country in which the account holder resides, or in which the business is legally established. This should be an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. For example, if you are in the United States and the business for which you're creating an account is legally represented in Canada, you would use `CA` as the country for the account being created. Available countries include [Stripe's global markets](https://stripe.com/global) as well as countries where [cross-border payouts](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/cross-border-payouts) are supported.
- `default_currency` (String) Three-letter ISO currency code representing the default currency for the account. This must be a currency that [Stripe supports in the account's country](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts).
- `documents` (Map of String) Documents that may be submitted to satisfy various informational requests.
- `email` (String) The email address of the account holder. This is only to make the account easier to identify to you. Stripe only emails Custom accounts with your consent.
- `external_account` (String) A card or bank account to attach to the account for receiving [payouts](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/bank-debit-card-payouts) (you wonâ€™t be able to use it for top-ups). You can provide either a token, like the ones returned by [Stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/js), or a dictionary, as documented in the `external_account` parameter for [bank account](https://stripe.com/docs/api#account_create_bank_account) creation. <br><br>By default, providing an external account sets it as the new default external account for its currency, and deletes the old default if one exists. To add additional external accounts without replacing the existing default for the currency, use the [bank account](https://stripe.com/docs/api#account_create_bank_account) or [card creation](https://stripe.com/docs/api#account_create_card) APIs.
- `individual` (Map of String) Information about the person represented by the account. This field is null unless `business_type` is set to `individual`.
- `settings` (Map of String) Options for customizing how the account functions within Stripe.
- `tos_acceptance` (Map of String) Details on the account's acceptance of the [Stripe Services Agreement](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/updating-accounts#tos-acceptance).
- `type` (String) The type of Stripe account to create. May be one of `custom`, `express` or `standard`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
