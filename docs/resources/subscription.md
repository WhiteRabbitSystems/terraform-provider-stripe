# stripe_subscription (Resource)





<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `customer` (String) The identifier of the customer to subscribe.

### Optional

- `add_invoice_items` (Block List) A list of prices and quantities that will generate invoice items appended to the next invoice for this subscription. You may pass up to 20 items. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--add_invoice_items))
- `application_fee_percent` (Number) A non-negative decimal between 0 and 100, with at most two decimal places. This represents the percentage of the subscription invoice subtotal that will be transferred to the application owner's Stripe account. The request must be made by a platform account on a connected account in order to set an application fee percentage. For more information, see the application fees [documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/subscriptions#collecting-fees-on-subscriptions).
- `automatic_tax_enabled` (Boolean) Whether Stripe automatically computes tax on this subscription.
- `backdate_start_date` (Number) For new subscriptions, a past timestamp to backdate the subscription's start date to. If set, the first invoice will contain a proration for the timespan between the start date and the current time. Can be combined with trials and the billing cycle anchor.
- `billing_cycle_anchor` (Number) A future timestamp to anchor the subscription's [billing cycle](https://stripe.com/docs/subscriptions/billing-cycle). This is used to determine the date of the first full invoice, and, for plans with `month` or `year` intervals, the day of the month for subsequent invoices. The timestamp is in UTC format.
- `billing_thresholds_amount_gte` (Number) Monetary threshold that triggers the subscription to create an invoice
- `billing_thresholds_reset_billing_cycle_anchor` (Boolean) Indicates if the `billing_cycle_anchor` should be reset when a threshold is reached. If true, `billing_cycle_anchor` will be updated to the date/time the threshold was last reached; otherwise, the value will remain unchanged. This value may not be `true` if the subscription contains items with plans that have `aggregate_usage=last_ever`.
- `cancel_at` (Number) A timestamp at which the subscription should cancel. If set to a date before the current period ends, this will cause a proration if prorations have been enabled using `proration_behavior`. If set during a future period, this will always cause a proration for that period.
- `cancel_at_period_end` (Boolean) Boolean indicating whether this subscription should cancel at the end of the current period.
- `collection_method` (String) Either `charge_automatically`, or `send_invoice`. When charging automatically, Stripe will attempt to pay this subscription at the end of the cycle using the default source attached to the customer. When sending an invoice, Stripe will email your customer an invoice with payment instructions and mark the subscription as `active`. Defaults to `charge_automatically`.
- `coupon` (String) The ID of the coupon to apply to this subscription. A coupon applied to a subscription will only affect invoices created for that particular subscription.
- `currency` (String) Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html), in lowercase. Must be a [supported currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies).
- `days_until_due` (Number) Number of days a customer has to pay invoices generated by this subscription. Valid only for subscriptions where `collection_method` is set to `send_invoice`.
- `default_payment_method` (String) ID of the default payment method for the subscription. It must belong to the customer associated with the subscription. This takes precedence over `default_source`. If neither are set, invoices will use the customer's [invoice_settings.default_payment_method](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/object#customer_object-invoice_settings-default_payment_method) or [default_source](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/object#customer_object-default_source).
- `default_source` (String) ID of the default payment source for the subscription. It must belong to the customer associated with the subscription and be in a chargeable state. If `default_payment_method` is also set, `default_payment_method` will take precedence. If neither are set, invoices will use the customer's [invoice_settings.default_payment_method](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/object#customer_object-invoice_settings-default_payment_method) or [default_source](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/object#customer_object-default_source).
- `default_tax_rates` (List of String) The tax rates that will apply to any subscription item that does not have `tax_rates` set. Invoices created will have their `default_tax_rates` populated from the subscription.
- `description` (String) The subscription's description, meant to be displayable to the customer. Use this field to optionally store an explanation of the subscription for rendering in Stripe surfaces.
- `items` (Block List) A list of up to 20 subscription items, each with an attached price. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--items))
- `off_session` (Boolean) Indicates if a customer is on or off-session while an invoice payment is attempted.
- `on_behalf_of` (String) The account on behalf of which to charge, for each of the subscription's invoices.
- `payment_behavior` (String) Only applies to subscriptions with `collection_method=charge_automatically`.

Use `allow_incomplete` to create subscriptions with `status=incomplete` if the first invoice cannot be paid. Creating subscriptions with this status allows you to manage scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.

Use `default_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with `status=incomplete` when the first invoice requires payment, otherwise start as active. Subscriptions transition to `status=active` when successfully confirming the payment intent on the first invoice. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscriptionâ€™s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. If the payment intent is not confirmed within 23 hours subscriptions transition to `status=incomplete_expired`, which is a terminal state.

Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's first invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not create a subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.

`pending_if_incomplete` is only used with updates and cannot be passed when creating a subscription.

Subscriptions with `collection_method=send_invoice` are automatically activated regardless of the first invoice status.
- `payment_settings_payment_method_options_acss_debit_mandate_options_transaction_type` (String) Transaction type of the mandate.
- `payment_settings_payment_method_options_acss_debit_verification_method` (String) Bank account verification method.
- `payment_settings_payment_method_options_bancontact_preferred_language` (String) Preferred language of the Bancontact authorization page that the customer is redirected to.
- `payment_settings_payment_method_options_card_mandate_options_amount` (Number) Amount to be charged for future payments.
- `payment_settings_payment_method_options_card_mandate_options_amount_type` (String) One of `fixed` or `maximum`. If `fixed`, the `amount` param refers to the exact amount to be charged in future payments. If `maximum`, the amount charged can be up to the value passed for the `amount` param.
- `payment_settings_payment_method_options_card_mandate_options_description` (String) A description of the mandate or subscription that is meant to be displayed to the customer.
- `payment_settings_payment_method_options_card_network` (String) Selected network to process this Subscription on. Depends on the available networks of the card attached to the Subscription. Can be only set confirm-time.
- `payment_settings_payment_method_options_card_request_three_d_secure` (String) We strongly recommend that you rely on our SCA Engine to automatically prompt your customers for authentication based on risk level and [other requirements](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication). However, if you wish to request 3D Secure based on logic from your own fraud engine, provide this option. Read our guide on [manually requesting 3D Secure](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/3d-secure#manual-three-ds) for more information on how this configuration interacts with Radar and our SCA Engine.
- `payment_settings_payment_method_options_customer_balance_bank_transfer_eu_bank_transfer_country` (String) The desired country code of the bank account information. Permitted values include: `DE`, `ES`, `FR`, `IE`, or `NL`.
- `payment_settings_payment_method_options_customer_balance_bank_transfer_type` (String) The bank transfer type that can be used for funding. Permitted values include: `eu_bank_transfer`, `gb_bank_transfer`, `jp_bank_transfer`, or `mx_bank_transfer`.

- `payment_settings_payment_method_options_us_bank_account_financial_connections_permissions` (List of String) The list of permissions to request. The `payment_method` permission must be included.
- `payment_settings_payment_method_options_us_bank_account_verification_method` (String) Bank account verification method.
- `payment_settings_payment_method_types` (List of String) The list of payment method types to provide to every invoice created by the subscription. If not set, Stripe attempts to automatically determine the types to use by looking at the invoiceâ€™s default payment method, the subscriptionâ€™s default payment method, the customerâ€™s default payment method, and your [invoice template settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice).
- `payment_settings_save_default_payment_method` (String) Either `off`, or `on_subscription`. With `on_subscription` Stripe updates `subscription.default_payment_method` when a subscription payment succeeds.
- `pending_invoice_item_interval_interval` (String) Specifies invoicing frequency. Either `day`, `week`, `month` or `year`.
- `pending_invoice_item_interval_interval_count` (Number) The number of intervals between invoices. For example, `interval=month` and `interval_count=3` bills every 3 months. Maximum of one year interval allowed (1 year, 12 months, or 52 weeks).

- `transfer_data_amount_percent` (Number) A non-negative decimal between 0 and 100, with at most two decimal places. This represents the percentage of the subscription invoice subtotal that will be transferred to the destination account. By default, the entire amount is transferred to the destination.
- `transfer_data_destination` (String) The account where funds from the payment will be transferred to upon payment success.
- `trial_end` (String) Unix timestamp representing the end of the trial period the customer will get before being charged for the first time. This will always overwrite any trials that might apply via a subscribed plan. If set, trial_end will override the default trial period of the plan the customer is being subscribed to. The special value `now` can be provided to end the customer's trial immediately. Can be at most two years from `billing_cycle_anchor`. See [Using trial periods on subscriptions](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/trials) to learn more.
- `trial_from_plan` (Boolean) Indicates if a plan's `trial_period_days` should be applied to the subscription. Setting `trial_end` per subscription is preferred, and this defaults to `false`. Setting this flag to `true` together with `trial_end` is not allowed. See [Using trial periods on subscriptions](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/trials) to learn more.
- `trial_period_days` (Number) Integer representing the number of trial period days before the customer is charged for the first time. This will always overwrite any trials that might apply via a subscribed plan. See [Using trial periods on subscriptions](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/trials) to learn more.

- `pending_update_expires_at` (Number) The point after which the changes reflected by this update will be discarded and no longer applied.
- `pending_update_subscription_items` (List of Object) List of subscription items, each with an attached plan, that will be set if the update is applied. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--pending_update_subscription_items))
- `pending_update_trial_end` (Number) Unix timestamp representing the end of the trial period the customer will get before being charged for the first time, if the update is applied.
- `pending_update_trial_from_plan` (Boolean) Indicates if a plan's `trial_period_days` should be applied to the subscription.

- `schedule` (String) The schedule attached to the subscription
- `start_date` (Number) Date when the subscription was first created. The date might differ from the `created` date due to backdating.
- `status` (String) Possible values are `incomplete`, `incomplete_expired`, `trialing`, `active`, `past_due`, `canceled`, or `unpaid`. 

For `collection_method=charge_automatically` a subscription moves into `incomplete` if the initial payment attempt fails. A subscription in this state can only have metadata and default_source updated. Once the first invoice is paid, the subscription moves into an `active` state. If the first invoice is not paid within 23 hours, the subscription transitions to `incomplete_expired`. This is a terminal state, the open invoice will be voided and no further invoices will be generated. 

A subscription that is currently in a trial period is `trialing` and moves to `active` when the trial period is over. 

If subscription `collection_method=charge_automatically` it becomes `past_due` when payment to renew it fails and `canceled` or `unpaid` (depending on your subscriptions settings) when Stripe has exhausted all payment retry attempts. 

If subscription `collection_method=send_invoice` it becomes `past_due` when its invoice is not paid by the due date, and `canceled` or `unpaid` if it is still not paid by an additional deadline after that. Note that when a subscription has a status of `unpaid`, no subsequent invoices will be attempted (invoices will be created, but then immediately automatically closed). After receiving updated payment information from a customer, you may choose to reopen and pay their closed invoices.
- `test_clock` (String) ID of the test clock this subscription belongs to.
- `trial_start` (Number) If the subscription has a trial, the beginning of that trial.
